# UtraHacks2018

The goal of this project was to develop a liquid dispenser to help those who do not have time in the morning to make breakfast for themselves. 

This project was developed in a four person team including myself. The other three members included an experienced web-developer, fourth year electrical engineering student, and a second year computer science student. A web app was developed so that clients could place in there order. In return they would recieve specific information about the type of drink they were ordering, including nutritional values like calories and whether that drink was available. Once the order was confirmed, data was sent though a Raspberry Pi B+ to a python script that processed the data and in return sent instructions to the Raspberry Pi that moved specific servo moters using circuits, letting the liquid flow out into the cup. 

Role: I co-developed the python script along side the other computer science student. I also set up the Raspberry Pi's development environment on my laptop and connected it to the python script. Lastly, I helped the electrical engineer set up the hardware using curcuit technology and I also helped in the building and processing of the actual product.
